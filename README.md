# C# in Action

## Description
As a student a took the C# in action course in my Bachelors at HSLU. The course is designed to provide an introduction to the C# programming language, focusing on .NET GUI programming. It builds upon my existing knowledge of Java programming and helps me expand my skills in a new language.

## Key Learnings
Throughout this course, I have gained proficiency in the following key areas:

1. Understanding References: I have learned how references work in C# and the differences compared to Java. This knowledge has helped me better manage memory and optimize my code.

2. Delegates and Event Handling: The course extensively covered delegates, which are powerful features in C#. I have grasped the concept of delegates and how they can be utilized for event handling, making my code more flexible and modular.

3. Exploring Multithreading and Synchronization: The course delved into the world of multithreading, teaching me how to create efficient and responsive applications. I have learned about cross-process synchronization, enabling me to build robust and scalable applications.

4. Socket Communication: I have gained practical knowledge of establishing communication using sockets. This has opened up possibilities for me to develop applications that interact with external devices or platforms, such as a robot platform.
